# data-structures-and-algorithms

A project created and maintained by myself for learning purposes. 
Written entirely in C++ using the CMake build tool.
Work-in-progress.

If you want to try it for yourself make sure you have CMake and mingw64 installed on your system and added your path, then copy the repository to your preferred destination, navigate to it, after which you can simply run "cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ." to set up the CMake project, then "cmake --build ." to build it. You can then launch the .exe files in their respective folders (e.g. /Array/Debug). 
Or alternatively, if you are using Visual Studio Code, you can install the CMake and CMake Tools extensions, set your debug target defined in "launch.json" in the parent .vscode folder, then press on F5 to build and run the program. 

Please keep in mind this is a work in progress project that I work on in my spare time for educational purposes. 
In case of any suggestions please open a pull request and I will happyily have a look at it.

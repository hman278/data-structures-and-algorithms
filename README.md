# Data structures and Algorithms
Self-educational repository created by following "The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need" by ThePrimeagen on frontendmasters. I am further investigating into lower level coding by using c++ and learning/integrating tests into my cmake environment. I am also implementing certain data structures that were not implemented in the original course for learning purposes.

This project is now using Dr Memory for memory tests. Make sure you have it installed and added to your PATH before using.
